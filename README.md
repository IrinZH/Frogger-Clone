# Frogger-Arcade Game Clone
Project demo can be found [here](https://ssaleem.github.io/Frogger-Clone/). The project is based on starter code from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).
## How to Run
Opening `index.html` loads the game.

## How to Play
The goal is to reach the water without colliding with any bugs. Use `up`, `down`, `left` and `right` arrow keys to move. 
The player has 3 lives to complete the game and with each collision a life is lost.
